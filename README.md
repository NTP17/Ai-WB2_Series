When downloading as ZIP, make sure to verify:
- File name: `Ai-WB2_Series-main.zip`
- SHA-256 checksum: `bcc5eb780b809fda4c0a15091302ea682fbcbb7daca88d1f448262b50bdb38d2` (might be changed in the future, as the files move in and out)

There are many ways to see the checksum, [this website](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256_checksum.html) is an example. If you have 7-zip, you can right click the file -> 7-zip -> CRC SHA -> SHA-256 to see it.
